# Guess The Number Game

Made to practice control flow and learning to use `while` which is to repeat something until the condition is met (just like this game) and is different from `def` which is to wrap reusable logics. Might practice other microprojects with `def` and might update this game with interactive UI in the future.

Run the file in your terminal:

``` bash
python guess-the-number/main.py
```
